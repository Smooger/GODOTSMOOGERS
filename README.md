# GODOTSMOOGERS

Broderick's Bathroom Dash is a 2D timed platformer prototype built with Godot. Run the project in Godot 4 and play through the starter level while collecting coins, grabbing time-boosting power-ups, and dodging enemies to reach the bathroom before the timer hits zero.


## Planning guide
